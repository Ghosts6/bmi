# üîçcode sample:

here we have c++ code, which use oop to handle data and if we want to talk about feature of this program we can 
point to advise that it give to us based on our bmi near calcute bmi.
        
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <stdio.h>

     double bmi;
     double wighetcost;
 };
 double a,b;
 int main(){
     info obj;

     obj.bmi=obj.wight/b;
     obj.wighetcost=obj.bmi - 18.5;
